# Chapter 4: Experimental Results

## 4.1 Experimental Setup

### 4.1.1 Hardware and Software Configuration

The experimental evaluation was conducted using a standardized computing environment to ensure consistent and reproducible results. The hardware configuration included an Intel Core i7-10750H processor with six cores and hyperthreading technology, 16GB DDR4 RAM, and NVMe SSD storage for fast data access and processing.

The software environment consisted of Python 3.10.9 as the primary programming language, supported by the Anaconda distribution for scientific computing. Core machine learning libraries included scikit-learn 1.2.2 for traditional algorithms, XGBoost 2.0.3 for gradient boosting, and TensorFlow/Keras 2.12.0 for neural network implementations. Data processing was handled using Pandas 2.0.3 and NumPy 1.24.3, while visualization relied on Matplotlib 3.7.1 and Seaborn 0.12.2.

To ensure experimental reproducibility, all random processes were controlled using fixed seed values (seed=42). Library versions were documented and maintained consistently throughout the study. Complete parameter configurations were recorded for each algorithm to enable result verification and comparison.

### 4.1.2 Model Implementation Framework

Four distinct machine learning approaches were implemented to represent different algorithmic paradigms commonly applied in fraud detection:

- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method utilizing 100 decision trees with balanced class weighting
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting algorithm optimized for efficiency and performance
- **Neural Network**: Multi-layer perceptron with dropout regularization and optimized architecture
- **Support Vector Machine**: SVM with RBF kernel and class weighting for imbalanced data

Each algorithm underwent systematic hyperparameter optimization through grid search procedures to identify optimal configurations for the fraud detection task.

## 4.2 Dataset Description

### 4.2.1 Data Source and Collection Method

The experimental evaluation utilized the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle, originally compiled by the Machine Learning Group at Université Libre de Bruxelles. This dataset contains real credit card transactions from European cardholders collected over a 48-hour period in September 2013, providing authentic transaction patterns for fraud detection algorithm development.

The dataset comprises 284,807 individual credit card transactions, representing a substantial volume of real-world financial data suitable for comprehensive machine learning model evaluation. Each transaction record includes temporal information, monetary amounts, and anonymized feature variables derived through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to protect customer privacy while preserving essential discriminative characteristics.

### 4.2.2 Data Preprocessing and Quality Assessment

Comprehensive data quality evaluation revealed exceptional dataset characteristics supporting robust experimental analysis. The dataset demonstrated complete absence of missing values across all transaction records, with minimal data duplication affecting only 0.38% of observations. Total memory utilization remained manageable at 67.36 MB, facilitating efficient processing workflows.

Feature engineering techniques were applied to enhance the original dataset attributes. Temporal features were constructed to capture cyclical patterns in transaction timing, including hour-of-day indicators and normalized time representations. Transaction amount features underwent logarithmic transformation to address distributional characteristics, while standardized calculations identified statistical outliers in transaction values.

### 4.2.3 Dataset Structure and Class Distribution

The dataset architecture consists of 31 attributes, including 28 PCA-transformed variables (V1 through V28) that preserve essential transaction characteristics while maintaining anonymity. Additional features include transaction timestamps (Time), monetary amounts (Amount), and binary classification labels (Class) indicating fraudulent activity.

The dataset exhibits severe class imbalance characteristic of real-world fraud scenarios. Normal transactions comprise 284,315 observations (99.827% of total), while fraudulent cases represent only 492 instances (0.173% of total). This extreme imbalance ratio of approximately 577:1 creates significant challenges for traditional machine learning approaches and necessitates specialized handling techniques.

| Monetary | 1 | Transaction amount | €0-€25,691.16 |
| Target Variable | 1 | Binary fraud indicator | 0 (Normal), 1 (Fraud) |

### 4.2.4 Class Imbalance Mitigation Strategies

Three distinct approaches were implemented to address the extreme class imbalance:

**Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)**: Generated synthetic fraudulent transaction examples through interpolation between existing minority class instances, increasing fraudulent sample representation while maintaining realistic feature distributions.

**Random Undersampling**: Randomly reduced majority class samples to achieve more balanced representation, decreasing computational requirements while potentially sacrificing some normal transaction information.

**Original Data Utilization**: Maintained original imbalanced distribution, leveraging algorithms with built-in mechanisms for handling class distribution disparities.
